"""
type Subscription {
  """
  Subscribes to real-time updates of Transactions that match the provided filter criteria.
  This subscription starts immediately and only includes Transactions added to the blockchain after the subscription is active.

  This is useful for applications needing to track Transactions in real-time, such as wallets tracking incoming transactions
  or analytics platforms monitoring blockchain activity.

  Returns:
  - Transaction: Each received update is a Transaction object that matches the filter criteria.

  """
  Subscribes to real-time updates of Blocks that match the provided filter criteria. Similar to the Transactions subscription,
  this subscription is active immediately upon creation and only includes Blocks added after the subscription begins.

  This subscription is ideal for services that need to be notified of new Blocks for processing or analysis, such as block explorers,
  data aggregators, or security monitoring tools.

  Returns:
  - Block: Each update consists of a Block object that satisfies the filter criteria, allowing subscribers to process or analyze new Blocks in real time.

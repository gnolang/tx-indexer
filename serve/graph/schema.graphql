type Subscription {

  Subscribes to real-time updates of Transactions that match the provided filter criteria.

  This is useful for applications needing to track Transactions in real-time, such as wallets tracking incoming transactions 
  or analytics platforms monitoring blockchain activity.
  
  Parameters:
  - filter: TransactionFilter - Specifies the criteria used to filter the Transactions for which real-time updates are desired.

  Returns:
  - Transaction: Each received update is a Transaction object that matches the filter criteria.

  transactions(filter: TransactionFilter!): Transaction!
  
  """
  Subscribes to real-time updates of Blocks that match the provided filter criteria. Similar to the Transactions subscription, 
  this subscription is active immediately upon creation and only includes Blocks added after the subscription begins.

  This subscription is ideal for services that need to be notified of new Blocks for processing or analysis, such as block explorers, 
  data aggregators, or security monitoring tools.

  Parameters:
  - filter: BlockFilter - Defines the conditions Blocks must meet to trigger an update to the subscriber.

  Returns:
  - Block: Each update consists of a Block object that satisfies the filter criteria, allowing subscribers to process or analyze new Blocks in real time.
